            <p class=brieftitle> THE PROCESS </p>
            <p>We first ask you a series of questions to determine needs and expectations. During the development of the site we meet three times, once upon the kick start of the project, once midway through the development of the site, and one last time right before testing and launching your site. Our terms are simple and straightforward.
