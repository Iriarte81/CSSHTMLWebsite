    <h1> <span itemprop="description"> Web Design + SEO </span>- A Complete Package </h1>

	<p class = textbody>Our standard package includes a <span itemprop="produces"> basic side coded in html5 and css3 </span>. The cost of the site will depend on the number of pages, the amount of content, and the type of content you wish to include (for example, if your site is dynamic, that is if it needs to comunicate with a database, the cost will be higher). </p>
<br>
<p class = textbody>During our initial meeting we will receive from you the appropriate content, including text you want to include and images. Images (logos and photos) are optimized for display on web browsers. We will then propose three design concepts from which you may choose one and propose modifications to better meet your needs and preferences.</p>
<br>
<p class = textbody> During the development phase we meet a total of three times. The initial interview sets the expectations and kicks off the start of the project. A midway meeting serves to revise what has been done and propose further modifications. A final meeting where final revisions are discussed. Upon receipt of full payment we upload your website to the net. </p>
<br>
<p class = textbody>
If you need a domain registered or hosting set up, we will guide you through the process. Unlike most<span itemprop="servicetype"> web design </span>companies out there, we will use our knowledge of SEO at no additional cost, so that the major search engines can find and index your site, and so that it stands the best chance to appear highly ranked onsearch engine results.
</p>
<br>
<br>
	<h2> Our terms are simple and straightforward </h2>

	<p class= textbody> Any images, domains, hosting or expenses exceeding the website will be discussed and billed as they are purchased. Payment is made at three stages, an initial deposit of 30% the total cost, made once you decide that you want us to start working on your project. Another deposit of 30% the total cost, at the time of the first revision. A final deposit of 40% after the project is completed. Once the balance is paid, I will transfer your site from my private test server to your live domain. </p>
